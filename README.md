# TSLang Compiler Project
This project aims to design a sample compiler for a custom language called TSLang. You can find detailed explanations of this language in the tslang_introduction file. The project's objective is to practice the practical implementation of a compiler for three compiler-related tasks:

1. Writing a lexical analyzer
2. Writing a syntax analyzer
3. Generating intermediate code

## Project Overview
The project is structured into three main steps:

1. Lexical Analysis: In this step, a lexical analyzer is implemented to tokenize the input.
2. Syntax Analysis: The input code is parsed in this phase. It involves breaking down the input and identifying its logical structure using parsing operations. Additionally, several types of errors are detected and reported during this stage.
3. Intermediate Code Generation: Based on the input, intermediate code for the TLang language is produced.
Practical information and examples are documented in the tslang_compiler_project file.

## Usage
To use the compiler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the Scanner directory.
3. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
4. Build the project.
5. Run the executable, providing the path to the TLang source file as an argument.
